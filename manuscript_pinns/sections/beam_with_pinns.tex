\chapter{Application of PINNs on 1D Beams}
In Sec. \ref{sec:pinns_formulation}, a general formulation for physics-informed neural networks is explained. 
Here, one-dimensional Euler-Bernoulli beams under the distributed load with uniform geomerical and material properties
are conducted, which are governed by an ordinary differential equation (Eq. \ref{eq:ode_space}) in static models and 
governed by a partial differential equation (Eq. \ref{eq:pde_time}) in continuous-time models.   
\label{sec:third}

\section{Static Models}
Consider the governing equations of one-dimesional linear elastic Euler-Bernoulli 
beam (Fig. \ref{fig:beam_clamped}) with the corresponding boundary conditions of clamped beam as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:static_beam_1}
    \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}\left(E I \frac{\partial^{2} w(x)}{\partial x^{2}}\right)+q(x)=0 \quad \text { on }\Omega
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:static_beam_2}
    \frac{\partial w(x)}{\partial x} = h \quad \text { on } \Gamma_{N},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:static_beam_3}
    w(x) = g \quad \text { on } \Gamma_{D}.
\end{equation} 

\noindent The Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions are denoted as $\Gamma_{N}$ and $\Gamma_{D}$. To give a better understanding, 
the spatial domain is defined $\Omega=[0,L]$, with $\Gamma_{D}= \{x | x = 0, x = L\}$ and $\Gamma_{N}= \{x | x = 0, x = L\}$. 
If the length of the beam is set to $L=1$, the following boundary conditions 
of a clamped support Euler-Bernoulli beam are obtained

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:static_beam_4}
    w(x=0)=0 & \text { and } & w_{x}(x=0)=0, \\
    w(x=1)=0 & \text { and } & w_{x}(x=1)=0.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The physics-informed neural network approximates the unknown solution $w(x)$
through the hidden layers enhanced with non-linear activation functions $\sigma$ using the spatial domain $x$ as the input 
as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:pinn_static_beam}.
Since only the solution on the boundaries are known, the predicted solution for every location inside the domain must fulfill
the Eq. \ref{eq:static_beam_1} such that 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:f_static}
    f:=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}\left(E I \frac{\partial^{2} w(x)}{\partial x^{2}}\right)+q(x).
\end{equation}

Here the $f$ term represents the residuum or physics-informed residual which has to be fulfilled at every point inside
the domain. The main purpose of PINNs is to minize the residuum enforcing the boundary conditions via the loss function.

Combining Eqs. \ref{eq:static_beam_4} and \ref{eq:f_static} with \ref{eq:Neumann_pinn}, 
\ref{eq:Dirichlet_pinn}, \ref{eq:res_loss}, \ref{eq:total_loss} and \ref{eq:total_loss_compact}, the loss function of 
static clamped Euler-Bernoulli beam is defined

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:app_static_overall_loss}
    \begin{aligned}
        L & = E_{u} +  E_{f} \\ 
          & = E_{Neumann} + E_{Dirichlet} + E_{f} \\ 
          & = \frac{1}{N_{b}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{b}}\left[\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} w_{P}\left(x_{b}^{i}\right)-h\right)^{2} +
          \left( w_{P}\left(x_{b}^{i}\right)-g\right)^{2} \right] + 
          \frac{1}{N_{f}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{f}}\left(f_{P} (x_{f}^{i})\right)^{2} \\
          & = \frac{1}{N_{b}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{b}}\left[\underbrace{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} w_{P}\left(x_{b}^{i}\right)\right)^{2}}_{\text{Neumann term}} +
          \underbrace{ \vphantom{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)} \left( w_{P}\left(x_{b}^{i}\right)\right)^{2}}_{\text{Dirichlet term}} \right] + 
          \frac{1}{N_{f}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{f}}\left(f_{P} (x_{f}^{i})\right)^{2}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent The $h$ and $g$ terms
are the prescribed Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions at $N_{b}$ 
boundary points $\left\{x_{b}^{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{N_{b}} = \left\{0,1\right\}$. 
Since the beam is considered as a clamped beam, $h=0$ and $g=0$.  
The last term of Eq. \ref{eq:app_static_overall_loss} minizes the error at every point inside the spatial domain,
called as the collocation 
points $\left\{x_{f}^{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{N_{f}}$. The collocation points can be generated using random or uniform distributions.

    \caption{An illustration of physics-informed neural network for the governing ordinary differential
    equation of the one-dimensional Euler-Bernoulli beam.}
    \label{fig:pinn_static_beam}
\end{figure}

For demonstrating the application of PINNs on the Euler-Bernoulli beams, three cases are further
investigated to involve the higher-order derivatives in the loss function as depicted 
in Fig. \ref{fig:beam_app_models}. For instance,
the clamped beam contains only the first order, while the cantilever beam contains the first, 
second and third-order derivatives (cf. \ref{fig:beam_cantilever}, \ref{fig:beam_pinn},
\ref{fig:beam_clamped}). For simplicity, Young's modulus and the moment of inertia terms are
set to $AE=1$, the beam length and the magnitude of the distributed loading are set to $L=1$ and $q=1$, relatively.

\vspace{5mm}
The following PINN architecture is used to compute the approximated solution:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Architecture contains 1 input layer, 1 output layer and 3 hidden layers
    containing 30 nodes.
    \item Hyperbolic tangent activation functions $tanh$ are used to non-linearize the outputs of the layers.
    \item The \textit{Glorot Uniform} initializer is applied to initialize the weights randomly to
    avoid dying out of the nodes.
    \item The \textit{Adam} optimizer with learning rate \textit{0.0005} is chosen as the optimization function.
    \item The number of collocation points is set $N_{f}=20$ and the Sobol sampling
    is performed to have a non-uniform distribution. 
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Three investigated beam models with their descriptions and analytical solutions.}
    \label{fig:beam_app_models}
\end{figure}

The results of the investigated cases are given in Fig. \ref{fig:static_res}. Figures on the left show that the
predicted displacements are almost identical to the analytical solutions at each collocation point as can be seen
in the magnitude of the loss function. On the other hand, there is a difference in terms of the order of magnitudes
of the loss functions between the differential equation loss and the total boundary losses. 
The reason is that the boundary conditions are not explicitly enforced. In Eq. \ref{eq:app_static_overall_loss}, 
the boundary condition losses are added to overall lost and this overall loss is minimized. To enforce the boundary
conditions, the loss function can be reformulated to a soft constraint problem or penalty methods can be considered
\cite{lu2021physics}.

\subsection{A complex consideration}

So far, simple beam structures with uniform material and geometrical properties under non-complex
loadings have been investigated. Consider a simply supported beam having the following non-uniform cross-section 

\begin{equation}
    I(x) = \left( \frac{x}{L} \right)^{2}
\end{equation}

under the following loading
\begin{equation}
    p(x)=\frac{8\pi^{2}\left(\left(2 \pi^{2} x^{2}-L^{2}\right) \sin (\frac{2 \pi x}{L})-4 \pi x \cos (\frac{2 \pi x}{L})\right)}{L^{4}},
\end{equation}


as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:beam_complex}. Applying the boundary conditions (Eq. \ref{eq:simply_supported_bc})
and using the governing equation of the beam theory (\ref{eq:static_beam_1}), the analytical solution is obtained

\begin{equation}
    w(x) = \sin (\frac{2\pi x}{L}).
\end{equation}

For simplicity, Young's modulus is set to $E=1$ and the length of the beam is set to $L=1$. 

\begin{figure}[!hb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.70]{beam_complex.png}  
    \caption{An illustration of a simple supported beam having non-uniformly distributed cross-section under an arbitrary load}
    \label{fig:beam_complex}
\end{figure}


The results of the investigated complex model is given Fig. \ref{fig:res_complex}. Similar to the previously 
conducted simpler models, 
figure on the left shows that the predicted displacements are almost identical to the true solution. 
On the contrary, the difference between differential equation loss and boundary equation loss is large compared
to the simple models (see \ref{fig:static_res}). The difference is due to the magnitude of the quantities. 
Since the applied load has a large magnitude compared to the predicted displacement, the initial differential loss
was $10^{8}$ larger than the boundary loss. During the training of the network, the difference becomes smaller
but they don't converge the same value since the boundary condition loss is not enforced explicitly which turns
into a unconstrained optimization problem if it is forced explicitly. Moreover, as a result of the complexity of the model, 
the loss has more oscillations and does not smoothly converge.

    \caption{On the figure left, the predicted and true deflection through the
    spatial domain are represented. On the figure right, the
    loss history containing the differential equation and boundary condition losses
    are given for each epoch.}

\end{figure}


\section{Continuous-Time Model}

Involving the time term to the Euler beam theory transforms the problem into a vibration problem and 
the behavior of the beam is governed by the Euler-Lagrange equation. The partial differential equation
of the one-dimensional Euler-Lagrange beam including Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions 
with initial conditions is formulated as 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dynamic_beam_1}
    \rho A \frac{\partial^{2} w(x,t)}{\partial t^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}\left(E I \frac{\partial^{2} w(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}\right) + q(x, t) = 0 \quad \text{ on } \mathcal{T} \otimes  \Omega
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dynamic_beam_2}
    \frac{\partial w(x,t)}{\partial x} = h \quad \text { on } \mathcal{T} \otimes \Gamma_{N},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dynamic_beam_3}
    w(x,t) = g \quad \text { on } \mathcal{T} \otimes \Gamma_{D},
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dynamic_beam_4}
    w(x,0) = g_{0} \quad \text{and} \quad w_{t}(x,0) = g_{t,0} \quad \text { on } \Omega.
\end{equation} 

Here, in addition to the spatial domain $\Omega$ in the static models, the temporal domain $\mathcal{T}$ is introduced. 
To give a better understanding, the spatial domain is defined $\Omega = [0,L=1]$, 
with $\Gamma_{D}= \{x | x = 0, x = 1\}$ and $\Gamma_{N}= \{x | x = 0, x = 1\}$ and 
the temporal domain i set to $\mathcal{T}=[0,1]$. Since the beam is particularly considered as a clamped support
Euler-Lagrange beam, the following homogenous boundary conditions are subjected to the problem 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:dynamic_beam_bc}
    w(0,t)=0 & \quad \text{and} & w_{x}(0,t)=0, \\
    w(1,t)=0 & \quad \text{and} & w_{x}(1,t)=0,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent with the following non-homogenous initial conditions 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dynamic_beam_ic}
    w(x,0)=\sin(\pi x) \quad \text{and} \quad w_{t}(x,0)=0.
\end{equation}

Similarly, physics-informed neural network approximates the unknown solution $w(x,t)$ using the spatial domain $x$ 
and temporal domain $t$ as inputs as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:pinn_dynamic_beam}. Since the predicted solution
has to fulfill the governing equation of Euler-Lagrange problem, residuum $f$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:f_dynamic}
    f:=\rho A \frac{\partial^{2} w(x,t)}{\partial t^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}\left(E I \frac{\partial^{2} w(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}}\right) + q(x, t).
\end{equation}

Combining Eqs. \ref{eq:dynamic_beam_bc}, \ref{eq:dynamic_beam_ic}, \ref{eq:f_dynamic} with \ref{eq:total_loss_compact}, 
\ref{eq:total_loss}, \ref{eq:Neumann_pinn}, \ref{eq:Dirichlet_pinn}, \ref{eq:Initial_pinn}, \ref{eq:res_loss}, the loss
function $L$ of a dynamic clamped supported Euler-Lagrange beam is derived as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:app_dynamic_overall_loss}
    \begin{aligned} 
        L & = E_{Neumann} + E_{Dirichlet} + E_{0} + E_{f} \\ 
          & = \frac{1}{N_{b}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{b}}\left[\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} w_{P}\left(x_{b}^{i},t_{b}^{i}\right)-h\right)^{2} +
          \left( w_{P}\left(x_{b}^{i},t_{b}^{i}\right)-g\right)^{2} \right] + \\
          & \quad \; \frac{1}{N_{0}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{0}}\left[\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} w_{P}\left(x_{0}^{i},0\right)-g_{t,0}\right)^{2} +
          \left( w_{P}\left(x_{0}^{i},0\right)-g_{0}\right)^{2} \right] + 
          \frac{1}{N_{f}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{f}}\left(f_{P} (x_{f}^{i},t_{f}^{i})\right)^{2} \\
          & = \frac{1}{N_{b}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{b}}\left[\underbrace{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} w_{P}\left(x_{b}^{i},t_{b}^{i}\right)\right)^{2}}_{\text{Neumann BC.}} +
          \underbrace{ \vphantom{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)} \left( w_{P}\left(x_{b}^{i},t_{b}^{i}\right)\right)^{2}}_{\text{Dirichlet BC.}} \right] + \\
          & \quad \; \frac{1}{N_{0}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{0}}\left[\underbrace{ \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} w_{P}\left(x_{0}^{i},0\right)-\sin (\pi x)\right)^{2} +
          \left( w_{P}\left(x_{0}^{i},0\right)\right)^{2}}_{\text{Initial C.}} \right] +  
          \frac{1}{N_{f}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{f}}\left(f_{P} (x_{f}^{i},t_{f}^{i})\right)^{2}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

While the Neumann and Dirichlet loss terms enforces the boundary conditions at $N_{b}$ random points 
$\left\{x_{b}^{i},t_{b}^{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{N_{b}}$ where $x=0$ and $x=1$, the initial loss terms enforce the initial conditions at 
$\left\{x_{0}^{i},0\right\}_{i=1}^{N_{0}}$, since the temporal domain is set to $t_{b}=0$. Finally, the last term assures 
that the predicted displacement fulfills the governing equation of the problem at random $N_{f}$ collocation points
$\left\{x_{f}^{i},t_{f}^{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{N_{f}}$ where the spatial domain $x \in [0,1]$ and the temporal domain $t \in [0,1]$. 


\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{pinn_dynamic_beam.png}  
    \caption{An illustration of physics-informed neural network for the governing
    partial differential equation of the one-dimensional Euler-Lagrange beam.}
    \label{fig:pinn_dynamic_beam}
\end{figure}


The further calculation of the continuous-time model of the Euler-Lagrange beam, Young’s modulus
and the moment of inertia terms are set to $AE = 1$ and additionally the density and the area of the cross-section terms 
are set to $\rho A=1$. Applying the following distributed load

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:force_time}
    q(x,t) = sin(\pi x) e^{-t} \left( \pi^{4}(t+1)+t-1 \right), 
\end{equation}

\noindent results in the analytical solution of the clamped Euler-Lagrange beam with the given boundary 
and initial conditions (see \ref{eq:dynamic_beam_bc} and \ref{eq:dynamic_beam_ic}) as follows

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:time_analytical}
    w(x,t) = \sin(\pi x)(t+1) e^{-t}.
\end{equation}


Compared to the PINN architecture of static models, a slightly more advanced model is generated since the input has two dimensions.
The PINN architecture to predict the space-time solution $w(x,t)$ has the following features

\begin{itemize}
    \item Architecture contains 2 input layers, 1 output layer and 3 hidden layers
    containing 100 nodes.
    \item Similarly Hyperbolic tangent activation functions $tanh$ are used with $Glorot Uniform$ initializer.
    \item The $Adam$ optimizer with learning rate $l_{r}=0.0001$ is chosen as the optimization method. 
    The number of $epochs$ is set as 20000. 
    \item The number of collocation points inside domain is set to $N_{f} = 20$, the number of boundary condition points is set
    to $N_{b}=50$ and the number of initial condition point is set to $N_{0}=50$. Additionally, the $Sobol$ sampling
    is performed have a random distribution.
\end{itemize}

The results of the Euler-Lagrange beam is given in Fig. \ref{fig:beam_time_res}. The comparison of the predicted 
and analytical solutions at different space and time intervals shows that the PINN architecture can predict the solution quite well
if the time term is kept constant. On the other hand, the predicted and analytical solutions have a small gap if the space term
is taken as constant. To fill this gap, the model is trained longer or the parameters of the PINN architecture are optimized using
hyper-parameter optimization techniques.

    \caption{The loss history containing
    the differential equation and boundary condition losses are given for each epoch.}
    \label{fig:beam_time_loss}
\end{figure}

In contrast to the static models, the overall loss contains also the initial condition loss as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:beam_time_loss}. 
The loss on the known conditions have a smooth decay to the convergence level, while the differential equation loss has local oscillations
due to the difference in magnitudes of order since the small changes in the predicted solution can lead to relatively large
oscillations during the training.
